<h1>Course Outline (Fall 2019)</h1>
<p>This is an introductory course in financial economics designed to give
students first-time detailed exposure to the wide variety of financial instruments
(assets and debt instruments) and the financial markets in which they are
traded. In this course you learn about stocks, options, real estate,
yield-bearing financial assets like bonds and notes, money market assets,
mutual funds, exchange traded products (ETFs and ETNs), futures contracts, 
retirement assets like 401-Ks, the
markets in which these are traded, various statistics, indices, quotations and
listings that pertain to these instruments, and theories about why these
financial instruments perform as they do. </p>

<p>The course blends <i>descriptive</i> and <i>theoretical</i> material. </p>

<p>By <i>descriptive</i> I mean that a considerable part of the course is
dedicated to merely describing what these assets and institutions are and how
they are used. The course has a very practical orientation. By the end of the
course the successful student will not only know what most of these esoteric
instruments are, but also how to find their quotations online and trade them.
In the section devoted to real estate, students will be shown, among other
things, how to buy a house - including qualifying for a mortgage, selecting 
the right type of loan, and going through escrow, and avoiding the kinds of 
problems that have plagued real estate in recent years.</p>

<p>In the <i>theoretical</i> part of the course you will explore interest rate
and yield formulas, theories of interest rate determination, portfolio and risk
theories, and general theories of financial asset price determination. </p>

<p>My secondary objective in this course is to encourage the student to think
about and develop financial goals and to develop the means to satisfy those
goals. </p>

<p>This course <i>is</i> demanding. Thought the material is not difficult,
students are given a large amount of material and a lot of reading to do, and
are expected to do it. This course, which is taught modular style (allowing the
presentation of large amounts of material quickly), presents a steady stream of
material throughout the semester. If you fall behind, it's hard to catch up. </p>

<h1>Reading, YouTube and other Media</h1>

<p>This course uses the free online text <b><a
href="../books/finance/introfinbook.html">Introduction
to Financial Markets and Instruments</a></b>, written by your teacher. This
book is a hybrid chapter-by-chapter text with a least one chapter always under
revision and typically all chapters revised at least once a year. This allows
the book to be very current and statistical references are to the most recent
data. Therefore the book is available only chapter by chapter and never as a
coherent whole. Because of this practice, if you are reading this book for this
class, you should not read any given chapter until it is assigned by the 
<a href="e104cc.htm">Course Calendar</a> 
or until the online chapter has the notation "[Ready for use in Fall 2019]".</p>

<p>This class also uses online audio and video material, most of it linked to
the reading, some of it produced by your teacher, other material downloaded.
Such material is assigned with the handouts as discussed below.</p>

<p>Since 2018 all lectures in this class have been streamed live from YouTube and after 
they are streamed they are archived in a YouTube playlist. Therefore students can choose 
to watch the lectures remotely, which a majority of students choose to do for most 
lectures. This is actively encouraged by your teacher. It gives students more freedom,
allows course conflicts, and allows a much larger enrollment in the class, making it
available to a larger number of students.</p>

<p>Please remember, though, that with this greater freedom comes responsibility. I 
don't take role (obviously) nor monitor your behavior. I leave it to you to determine
how to meet the requirements of the class. As a student you are still required to 
either attend or watch all lectures ... it is not an option ... many of the 
exam questions come straight from the lectures. A lot of low grades are given in 
Econ 104 and it is usually because students have fallen behind and never catch up.</p>

<p>The lectures are found on the <b>ProfGREvans</b> YouTube channel and are posted 
under the <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfGREvans/playlists?view_as=subscriber">
Economics 104</a> playlist.</p>

<h1>Class Handouts and Assignments</h1>

<p>High-quality color versions (pdf) of all of the lecture slides are posted for each 
lecture set on the <a href="e104ls.htm">
Econ 104 Course Content</a>  page. The slide sets are always
posted just before the lectures begin and are available for students to use
during the lecture. This page also has links to all of the online book chapters
and other reading material. As described above, the actual lecture is streamed
live on YouTube and the archive of the same lecture is posted in the playlist.
The posting of the archive is not immediate. It is typically posted the following
morning and will always be posted within 24 hours of the delivery of the lecture. 
Therefore, effectively, the entire class has a complete digital record accessible 
from the Course Content page. The video lectures will be removed after the final
exam has been given.</p>

<p>I will also assign a small amount of homework throughout the semester (but not 
much in this class). The homework assignments tend to be of two sorts: tracking the
performance of selected financial assets (like stocks, bonds, and mutual
funds) and making calculations on yields, rates of return, and so forth. The
homework will not be graded nor even collected as the class proceeds. You are 
required to keep your completed homework because you may need to access it to take 
answer certain exam questions. </p>

<p>To see the schedule of modules and exams, refer to the <a
href="e104cc.htm">Econ 104 Course Calendar</a>.</p>

<p>Homework information and important reminders are sent out to the class
master list by email. Therefore, please make sure that you are on this list. </p>

<h1>Examinations and Grades</h1>

<p>In this class I give three examinations including the final. All are equally
weighted. The scheduled dates for the exams are shown in the <a
href="e104cc.htm">Course Calendar</a>. For
the final grade I sum the numeric scores of the three exams and assign a letter
grade based upon your placement in the total. <b>Your grade will depend
entirely upon the final distribution for all students for all three exams at
the end of the semester and by no other criteria.</b></p>

<p><b><span style='color:red'>Note for 2019: </span></b>
Because of the large projected class size of Econ 104 in Fall 2019, I
will be giving <b>only</b> online exams that will require each student to log into
the exam site in or near the classroom on the day and during the hours that the 
class is scheduled. (An alternative time will be scheduled for students who have a
time conflict or are ill and <i>only</i> for those students). This differs from the 
past in that about half of the exam 
consisted of essay questions graded by Professor Evans rather than a computer. Now
the entire exam is computerized with one exception. The final exam will have a 
take-home component that will be an essay question or two. </p>

<p>This new practice for administering exams will be justified and explained in the
opening lectures. Before the first exam you will be given an ungraded practice quiz 
in order to become more familiar with the online format.</p>

<p>It is easy to make mistakes when grading exams. You have the right to appeal
a grade on an exam so long as the following procedure is used: </p>

<p><i>To appeal a grade on an exam, you must submit to me the basis of your
complaint (explaining why you should have been given a higher score) in writing
on an 8 1/2&quot; by 11&quot; sheet of paper within a
week of the day when I return the graded exam to the class. </i>. I will be willing 
to talk to you about your exam, but not about changing the score on your exam,
unless you have first followed the procedure above. </p>

<p>To this rule I make one exception: if I have improperly posted your grade
because I made a mistake adding the score, you need only tell me. </p>

<p><b>Policy on Pass/No Pass: I automatically allow any student who wishes to
take the course on a P/NP basis to do so if the student is eligible. HOWEVER</b>,
<b>to receive a passing grade the student must have accumulated enough points
to receive the equivalent C- or better!
Prior to the final, do not ask me how many points you must earn on the final to
pass. I will not tell you because I will not know. In addition to that rule, to
pass this course <i><span
style='color:red'>you must pass the final exam including its take-home
component</span></i>, regardless of your score on the two mid-terms, Your final
grade will depend upon the final distribution <i>after </i>the final has been
taken.</b></p>
<h1>How to Contact Me</h1>
<p>My office hours are on Wednesday from 1:00 until 2:30 and Thursday from 1:00
until 2:30. If you merely drop by there is a good chance you will find me. I 
will often be there on the other three days of the week as well.</p>

<p>I do make appointments - that way we can meet at a time convenient to both
of us. The best way to make an appointment is by email. If you ask after class
and I don't have my calendar with me, I might forget! My primary email address
is <b><i>evans</i></b><b><i>
(at) g.hmc.edu</i></b>

<p>I look forward to working with you in this class. </p>
