<h1>Reading and Homework Assignments - Fall 2019</h1>
<!--- <p><b><font color="red">Note!: </font></b>This is a draft version of the Course Calendar
prepared in Summer 2019. There may be some changes to this before the class starts
in the fall. This text will be removed when the final version is complete, sometime in early
September. 
</p> --->
<p>The primary reading material used
in this class is a free online book written by your teacher named <b>
<a href="../books/finance/introfinbook.html">Introduction to
Financial Markets and Instruments</a></b>. Because this online book is revised
and updated throughout the semester (the reason is explained in the
introduction to the book) you should read the material only when it is
assigned, which will normally be just before the module begins (see below), or
after the online chapter has the notation "[Ready for use in Fall 2019]."</p>

<p>In this class I lecture and assign reading, videos and homework assignments by
modules, rather than week-by-week. This gives you some leeway in developing a
reading schedule. <i>It is very important that you try to keep up with the
reading - background material is very important in this class.</i> </p>

<p>All of the reading material and other assignments are located on
the <a href="e104ls.htm">Course Content
Page</a>, which also includes all of the lecture slides used in this course
plus video recordings of
the lectures. The lecture slides are posted just before the lectures are given
(so that they can be referred to during the lecture) and the videos are posted within 24 hours (typically)
after the lecture is given.</p>

<p>There are not very many homework assignments in Economics 104. Homework
assignments are typically not collected nor graded, but we will be discussing
them on the dates that they are due. Additionally,<b> keep all copies of these 
homework assignments. You may be required to use
them on an examination.</b></p>
