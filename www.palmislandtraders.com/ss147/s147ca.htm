<p>This page holds a list of reading, discussion, and homework assignments that we will use throughout the semester.
Material is added to this page throughout the semester and sometimes the archive material is revised (that will always
be marked with a <b><font color="red">new</font></b> label).  Do not download this material until you have been 
instructed to so so in class.
</p>
<h1>Instructions & Advice for Visiting Class Speakers and/or Pitch Judges</h1>
<p>If you are giving a guest lecture or acting as a pitch judge for Enterprise and the Entrepreneur then you want to review 
information found in at least two of these three links. The students in this class and I are deeply grateful for your contribution
to our education. We thank you! Speakers and pitch judges coming to class often ask for guidance and the first two documents 
offer that. Also given that your expenses are covered by the Harvey Mudd College Entrepreneurial Network the third document 
gives procedures for expense reimbursement. Please follow the procedures for expenses but it is very time consuming for Prof 
Evans to process the paperwork for these.

<h1>Major Assignments and Support Material</h1>
<p>(Don't use this until assigned - much of this will be refined or changed as this semester proceeds):</p>
<div id="bpoints"> 
	<ul>
		<li>End-of-semester task: Writing a summary and reaction to <i>Blitzscaling.</i></li>
			<p class="intern">This assignment is required if you are not on a pitch team.</p>
			<p class="intern">Read <i>Blitzscaling</i> and either (a) write a short paper, about 500 words in length, that
			summarizes the primary theme in the book, then offer your reaction to book, or (b) create a reaction video doing
			the same and put it on YouTube (you can remove it later after I have watched it if you want).</p>
		<li>About the HMC INQ and HMC INQ companies:</li>
			<p class="intern">Go to the incubator website:  
			<a href="https://hmcinq.com/">
			HMC INQ</a> to see what is happening at the incubator!
			</p>
			<p class="intern">
			Sergey Tsalkov is interviewed by Indie Hackers about
				<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/arkservers-io">ArkServers.io</a> and building the company
				from scratch.
			</p>
		<li>The Sam Altman video series How to Start a Startup</li>
			<p class="intern">
			This is a Creative Commons video lecture series of 20 lectures arranged by Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator)
			and taught at Stanford in 2014 entitled 
			<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/">How to Start a Startup</a> 
			I will assign two of these for discussion per week (and I will allow a little sloppiness - it is like having
			a separate course within a course). In the DA section above, the assignment for discussion will be labeled <b> SAL1 </b> (for 
			lecture 1). No prepared questions are arranged for this series. 
			</p>
		<li>The NPR Guy Raz entreprenerial podcast series How I Built This</li>
			<p class="intern">
			National Public Radio offers a podcast called <a href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This. </a>
			These podcasts were first recommended by Kimberly Joly '18 and among the current selections she recommends:
				<ol class="intern">
					<li>Spanx, Kate Spade, and Rent the Runway: big focus on the persistence and dedication the founders maintained to build their business</li>
					<li>Instagram: good example of how Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger pivoted from their initial idea to keep their business viable</li>
					<li>Airbnb: some clever ideas to raise money and how they convinced reluctant people that renting out their home is a good idea</li>
					<li>TRX: really goes through building his business step-by-step in detail, from developing his idea in a business class, to 
						manufacturing the product himself, to fighting against counterfeit products.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		<li>Product Proposal  Video  </li>
			<p class="intern"> Go to this
			<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pB4IM4Z3o_7kZQMAKU2gQXaqUM8-NZi6HQ1qfz2EKvQ/edit?usp=sharing">Google Drive Doc</a> 
			called ss147_vid_s19 and add your embedded YouTube link as per instructions on the page. Just copy what is there now 
			and sub in your info.
			</p>
			<p class="intern">Early in the course you are required to develop a product idea and 
			pitch it to your peers by making a video. The instructions for doing that are found here:  
			<a href="prodpitch.pdf">
			Product Proposal Pitch Instructions</a>
			</p>
			<p class="intern">
			To review your pitch later, print, review, then later use this 
				<a href="videorev.pdf">Personal Review of your Video.</a>
			</p>
			<p class="intern">
			Finally, print and review the 
				<a href="eepc.pdf">e&e Peer Consulting Guidelines</a> for Courtesy.
			</p>
		<li>Corporate Financial Design (Capitalization) </li>
			<p class="intern">This is a complicated homework that is designed to show you how 
			to design the capital structure of your startup given your strategic plans for 
			fund raising and an exit. This homework requires you to (1) download an Excel 
			zip file labeled 
			<a href="csd.zip">
			Corporate Structure Design</a>, 
			then (2) download a homework 
			assignment entitled
			<a href="omsys.pdf">
			Omsys</a>
			, then (3) listen to a Video file labeled <a href="https://youtu.be/DNYELV4UApI">Capitalization</a> 			
			Design. [Note: You need to listen to the video file, but if you want a copy of 
			the slide set on which that file is based,
			<a href="capdesignmaster.pdf">
			here it is].</a>
			  </p>
			<p class="intern">You should download the Excel file first, open it and look at it, 
			briefly read the homework assignment, then watch the Capitalization Design video. 
			After watching the video, do the homework. Keep in mind that the Excel Corporate 
			Structure Design workbook will also be used in class after you have formed your 
			imaginary companies in order to design your cap plans for them. </p>
			</p>
		<li>Y-Combinator Pitch Guide</li>
			<p class="intern">HMC INQ is modeled in part after Y-Combinator. Y-Combinator accepts new teams based upon video pitches,
			then each team gives a live pitch during "demo days." Here is the <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/guide-to-demo-day-pitches/">
			Guide to Demo Day Presentations</a> that might help prepare for pitches in general.</p>
