<h1>SS147 Course Objectives, Fall 2019</h1>
<p>
The objectives for this course are not easy to define. I teach the course because I appreciate the importance of entrepreneurship 
in our society and others. Among other things, I want to encourage some of our students to become entrepreneurs -- to become innovators 
and managers of the technology that will define our future. I enjoy working with students who are excited by the spirit of entrepreneurship. 
Perhaps the primary objective of this course is to encourage and refine that spirit. </p>
<p>Additionally, I try to develop or enhance skills that raise the probability of success for 
students who aspire to someday become involved in entrepreneurial ventures.  This objective can be further subdivided into a number of categories:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Awareness of the entrepreneurial environment, including the role played by law and contracts, personnel and other labor management issues, 
	fundraising, marketing and sales techniques, etc.</li>
	<li>Stressing the importance of planning and strategy and the devices for implementing them, such as the plan of business, timelines, 
	project management skills, etc.</li>
	<li>Exposure to certain business fundamentals that an entrepreneur should know before 
	starting out.</li>
	<li>Consideration of issues of character, personality, and moral responsibility. </li>
	<li>The capacity for promotion and becoming a tenacious champion of the Koz (traditionally stressed very strongly 
	in this class). </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h1>What do we do in this class?</h1>
<p>
This is a course that combines reading, my lectures, guest lectures, class discussion, video presentations and team presentations. </p>

<p>If you look at the course calendar you will see that I have reading, lectures and discussions arranged by topics, such as discussions of 
financing, building the team, sales, etc.  There will typically be a reading assignments for the week (see the section below on <b>Reading and Grades </b>
with lectures about the material being considered). For some readings we will have in-class discussions of the reading assignments.</p>

<p>We are going to study examples of entrepreneurial success and failure. I present a lot of "cookbook" material based upon the business 
experience of others, mostly Mudders.  We will have a number of visitors in this class who will come and and offer insights and lessons
based upon experience.</p>

<p>In the first half of the semester, <em>all</em> of you (most of you working with one or two others) will be required to develop a product idea, 
then try to convince the rest of the class that it is a good idea, by making a three-to-six-minute 
<b>video pitch</b>. (Video pitches from years past are linked at the top of the page. Take a look). The rest of the class will vote on your pitch, 
thumbs up or thumbs down, online.</p>

<p>In the second half of the semester 20 of you will be organized into four teams of five and will be given the task of developing the plans 
for a start-up enterprise. The final result will be a clear plan of business and your team will present a verbal project proposal to outside visitors. You will 
receive both an individual and team grade for this effort. As the project is developed, individual team members will make progress reports. 
Details on this assignment will be provided in class. [How the 20 are decided will be explained in the first week].</p>

<p>The remainder of you in the class (not in the 20) will be allowed to work in teams on targeted research projects. The range of projects offered will 
also be discussed in the opening weeks of the class. <!---You can see examples of past projects on the course assignments page (see the link on the top).--->

<h1>Reading and Video</h1>
<p>
There is not a lot of reading in this course, but what there is is essential. There are two books formally assigned for this course:</p>

<p><b>The Startup Checklist: 25 Steps to a Scalable, High-Growth Business</b>, by David S. Rose, Wiley, ISBN 9781119163794, 2016 (code SCL in the 
course calendar).</p> 

<p><b>Blitzscaling: The Lightening-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies</b>, by Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh, ISBN 9781524761417, 2018 (code BLS in 
the course calendar).</p>

<p>There is also a video that you must watch on your own (rent or buy) for eventual discussion: "The Social Network," January 2011, starring Jesse Eisenberg. Although
this is fiction, it is a reasonably accurate account about the founding of Facebook.</p>

<p>Review the course calendar for the reading assignments. 
You are expected to have completed the assigned reading for each week prior to the beginning of class on Tuesday for that week. I currently trust you to read
the assigned material when assigned. You are all grown adults and I don't want to play assigment cop all semester long. It takes too much class time. By
enrolling in this class you are agreeing to do it, so please just comply. </p>

<p>I also have some recommended books that you might review and/or read in the future or as time permits this semester. These are not formally assigned but
they have useful information for the aspiring entrepreneur. They include:</p>
<p><b>Engineering You Start-up: A Guide for the High-Tech Entrepreneur</b>, by James A. Swanson and Michael L. Baird, 2nd edition, Professional 
Publications, ISBN 1888577916 (the text that I used to use, but now out of print, although you can get a used 2nd edition). </p>
<p><b>Value Proposition Design</b>, by Alex Osterwalder et. al., Wiley 1st edition, ISBN 1118968050 </p>
<p><b>The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company</b>, by Steve Blank, ISBN 0984999302 </p>
<p><b>The New Strategic Selling</b>, by Robert B. Miller and Stephen E. Heiman, ISBN 044669519X </p>
<p><b>Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In</b>, by Roger Fisher and William L. Ury, 2011, ISBN  0143118757 </p>
<p>There are two video series that I recommend for your consideration. First, I am also assigning some videos from the Sam Altman (co-founder of Y-Combinator) video series
<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/" target="_blank">How to Start a Startup</a>. This series is described on the 
<a href="s147ca.htm">Course Assignments</a> page. Not all of the videos are assigned 
and only one or two will be discussed in class.</p>
<p>Second, other reviewers of online video material have recommended the free Udacity series 
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-build-a-startup--ep245" target="_blank">How to Build a Startup</a>. This is a detailed
series ... essentially a full course ... and it is not formally assigned for this course. You might consider taking the course before the class starts
or sometime in the futures. Please note that I have not reviwed this course. As I said above it is recommended by others and should be seen as a possible
supplement to what I do.</p>
<h1>Grades</h1>
<p>Because this is a seminar course, we don't rely upon exams. However, I am going to assign some graded online quizzes based upon the reading and related assignments.
They will be weighted at 20% of your grade. The rest of your grade will be based upon <em>active</em> class participation and the pitches and the projects at the 
end of the semester. In case you're reading this fast, let me write it again: 
I expect <em>active</em> class participation. Very active! Additionally, unlike my other classes,  <em>full time class attendance is absolutely mandatory</em>. Do 
<em>not enroll </em>
in this class unless you are fully committed to attend every class. Although I will forgive missed attendance for illness or necessary appointments (like 
job interviews) you must otherwise attend every session of this class. If you do miss a class, I require that you email me explaining why.</p>
<p>Ultimately our <b>grade</b> in this class is entirely subjective. It depends upon the impression you make upon me. I expect to see enthusiastic participation 
in this class and in entrepreneurship. I expect you to more or less act like an entrepreneur. (This is the way it is done in a corporation 
and in the kinds of public contact one makes when one is an entrepreneur - you don't take tests in real life, except for when you're 
getting your driver's license. And when you apply for your all-critical funding for your startup, do you think you take a little timed exam? 
No, you make an impression on your funders or you are shown the door).
