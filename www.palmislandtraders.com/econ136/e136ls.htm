<h1>Quiz schedule for the rest of the semester</h1>
<p><font color="red"><b>Note!: </b></font>The switch to remote instruction in the second half of the semester required an
adjustment to the exam schedule for this class. This page and the Course Calendar page was changed on <font color="red"><b>April 11 </b></font>to reflect some changes.
Not all remaining quizzes are shown (they are added as the topics are being taught). All remaining quizzes will be taken online. For all 
of them, multiple-day choices will be given. 
</p>
<p>The grading in this course will be substantially eased, both by offering easier quizzes and by droppping the scale considerably. If I
see a good-faith effort to work through the material with me you will get at least an A- and the majority of you will get solid A's. If 
you blow it off you will earn a lower grade.
</p>
<p>You are allowed to take this course P/NC by merely asking. You may ask at any time up until May 26 (which is after you receive your grade).
</p>
<p><font color="red"><b>Note!: </b></font>All quizzes can be taken over 2 to 4 days and are available for 23:50 hours on the dates shown, beginning at 12:05 AM 
and ending 11:55 PM PDT, unless on consecutive days, in which case there is no break near midnight.</p>

is useful). Critical email messages will always be sent as text. There may be some audio files that are not email audio (indicated by title).
