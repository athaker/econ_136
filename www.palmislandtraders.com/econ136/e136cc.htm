<h1>Course Calendar for Spring 2020</h1>
<p><font color="red"><b>Note!: </b></font>The switch to remote instruction in the second half of the semester required an
adjustment to the exam schedule for this class. This page was changed on <font color="red"><b>April 11 </b></font>to reflect some changes.
Not all remaining quizzes are shown (they are added as the topics are being taught). All remaining quizzes will be taken online. For all 
of them, multiple-day choices will be given. 
</p>
<p>The grading in this course will be substantially eased, both by offering easier quizzes and by droppping the scale considerably. If I
see a good-faith effort to work through the material with me you will get at least an A- and the majority of you will get solid A's. If 
you blow it off you will earn a lower grade.
</p>
<p>You are allowed to take this course P/NC by merely asking. You may ask at any time up until May 26 (which is after you receive your grade).
</p>
<p>Economics 136 is a non-linear course. We will cover the topics below more or 
less in the order presented within each of the eight fields shown, but the fields are often presented simultaneously.
For example, we will start with a discussion of <i>Setting up Python, Numpy, et.al.</i> but will also cover
<i>Stock and option foundational assumptions</i>at the same time. We may not be able to cover every topic shown but we will
try. </p>
