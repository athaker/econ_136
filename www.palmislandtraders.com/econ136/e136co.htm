<h1>Course Outline for Spring 2020</h1>
<p>Welcome to my course on financial derivatives and modeling.  This is the second course of two finance 
courses offered to students at Harvey Mudd College. This course is designed to be an extension of 
Economics 104, my introductory finance course, <b>which is a prerequisite for this course</b>. 
</p>
<p>To get a better idea of the topics that we are going to cover, look at the 
<a href="e136cc.htm">Course Calendar</a>.
The topics to be covered include a review of measures of risk and volatility, modeling 
of put and call options, futures, and a lot of advanced theory.  
We give special emphasis to understanding and using value and pricing models and volatility models. You will
be exposed to a lot of advanced trading theory.
</p>
<p>
</p>You also experiment with some data gathering and algorithmic program trading models. We write our own models 
in Python and there is a substantial amount of that kind of modeling.
<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>Mostly we want to explore the exotic and fascinating world of financial derivatives.  We will begin 
by simply understanding how they work and for what purpose they are used.  Then we probe a little more 
deeply to develop rational explanations of their pricing and valuation, then discuss arbitrage, 
hedging and trading possibilities. By the end of the class, students should feel comfortable about 
much of this complex financial environment.
</p>
<p>Some of you may choose to work in finance for quant funds or trading houses as investment analysts 
or quant traders. Every year we seem to place more students into this industry 
(why? <i>because they love Mudd quants!!</i>). This course is carefully tailored to expose you to some 
of the fundamental modeling and analysis common to this field. As a one-semester course we can only
emphasize certain topics while ignoring others but at least you can get a taste of what is involved.
</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>This course <i><b>requires</b></i> that you have taken <b>Economics 104 - Financial Economics
</b> or the equivalent at 
another college.  Generally, a student in this class must be very familiar with the structure and 
operations of equity and bond markets because this course covers the market for derivatives that are 
derived from those fundamental markets.  There is no review of those markets in this class.  
It is assumed that you know this material already. 
</p>
<p>We are also going to do a lot of financial modeling using the 
<b>Python</b> programming language. You <b>must</b> know how to use Python and also know or be willing
to learn Numpy and Pandas. Some programming will be done in 
the classroom in a cooperative team environment which may make this a little easier.
</p>
<p>Any student enrolled in this class should have a substantial math background. 
Harvey Mudd students should have no problems but if you are from another campus and have a 
limited math background you might want to look at some of the later lectures from last year 
(posted on the bottom of the 
<a href="e136ls.htm">E136 Lecture Slides</a> page) 
to see if you can 
understand the material. Generally, you should understand natural logs and how they work, 
be able to use multi-variable calculus, be able to use or be prepared to learn Fourier
Transforms and be prepared to use multiple applications of the kind of statistics that are
used in Econometrics.
</p>
<h1>The Course Calendar</h1>
<p>Either now or when you complete this course outline you should consult the 
<a href="e136cc.htm">Course Calendar </a> 
for this class. Unlike my practice in other classes that I teach, there are 
no links to reading or other assignments on the Course Calendar. Instead, 
all links to lectures, videos, reading, homework and other assignments are 
found on the 
<a href="e136ls.htm">Lecture Slides </a>page. 
Instead, the Course Calendar lays out the all-important online quiz dates and exam dates and other 
critical deadlines while showing how the course is divided into eight modules. 
Within those modules various topics are listed in the order in which they will 
likely be presented. As that document points out, though, as the class proceeds 
some of these topics might be blended, rearranged, supplemented, or even abandoned. 
Some of the modules are taught simultaneously. This is <b>not</b> a linear course!
</p>
<p>Most of the models presented in this class are prepared before the class was
offered. However, these are large, complex models, always in some stage of development,
so we spend a fair amount of time together, teacher and students, continuing to improve
and enhance the models. 
</p>
I  also add change material 
based in part upon the continuous dialog that I have with my students. You often 
come up with other interests that we pursue and you sometimes come up with better 
ways of presenting this complex material. And every now and then students will 
find a mistake in the material (especially the math) so we correct it and press on.
</p>
<h1>Reading Material and Homework Assignments</h1>
<p>There is no textbook formally assigned to this course. There used to be, but 
the textbook used was intended for graduate-level instruction and as this course 
was refined over the years, the content drifted away from the text material, 
becoming specialized for Mudd students and applications that are interesting for 
that cohort. Additionally the course now has a major component dedicated to modeling with
Python, which is not discussed in the old text. Therefore we now use the text but only as 
an <b>optional reference</b> source. 
It is up to you to decide whether you want to buy it. The textbook is quite good 
(although very difficult to read) - it is the educational bible for this kind of course. 
You might decide to share with another student and to <b>buy an older out-of-print 
edition</b> (there is no meaningful loss in content at all). A new edition of the text is 
over-priced ($229!). The textbook in question is <b><i>Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives,</i></b>
by John C. Hull, 10th edition, ISBN 013447208X <b>or any edition if you can get it cheaper</b>.  
Do not buy this book before we meet for the first time. 
</p>
<p>Much of our class information comes from some very detailed PowerPoint slides that 
I will use in my lectures and from posted video lectures.  We will also rely upon a lot of 
reading material that is 
available free from the internet.  When the time comes we will simply find it (
I provide the URLs), download it, print it (maybe), and read it, all for free!  
The internet has proven to be an increasingly reliable source of good material for 
courses like this. All slides for my lectures are posted before the lecture on the 
<a href="e136ls.htm">Lecture Slides </a>web page.
</p>
<p>We also have some interactive course assignments which are typically Python programs.  
Some of these we will do together in class, and some you will do after class 
hours. These assignments also will be made available on the 
<a href="e136ls.htm">Lecture Slides </a>web page. 
Postings to this page will be made as the class proceeds. I will tell you during lectures 
when it is time to do one of these assignments.  These homework assignments are typically 
not corrected and are not graded, but quiz and exam questions are sometimes based upon these 
assignments and in some cases I may require you to bring the completed assignment to the 
examination to extract material for exam questions.
</p>
<p>This class now <b>requires</b> that you and your team do your modeling in Python. You must have
access (typically through your laptop) to Python 3 (we do not allow Python 2 to be used in this 
class). Your teacher knows that <b>MatLab</b> and <b>R</b> are extremely powerful packages that can be used for 
finance, and <b>MatLab</b> documentation is better than Python documentation, but we will all be working
with Python 3. This is not an option.</p>
<p>Whereas I do not care which IDE you use with Python, I strongly recommend that you download the 
<b>Anaconda</b> distribution of Python 3, because it has all of the libraries that we will want to use.
This will be discussed in an early lecture.
</p>
<h1>Class Attendance Requirements</h1>
<p>Because we are trading collectively and working together on homework projects and algos, 
in this class <b>attendance is mandatory</b>. If you have had me for other large lecture courses 
you know that I don't have such a requirement there but this class is different. You are 
required to attend every session unless you have a reasonable excuse. And if you have a 
reasonable excuse (which I certainly allow) you must email me prior to the class to inform 
me why you will be absent. I am not likely to answer the email.
</p>
<p><b>Do not take this class unless you understand this attendance rule and agree to abide by it.</b> 
I will grade you down if you make a habit of missing classes regardless of how you perform on exams.
</p>
<p>You are also required to bring a laptop to class every time we meet.
</p>
<h1>Team Assignments</h1>
<p>Early in the semester I am going to ask the class to divide into teams of five people each (give or
take one). Each team will be given some work assignments, mostly for background research. The class 
will also be asked to do some supplementary coding in the classroom on certain days and these assignments
are undertaken by teams rather than individuals. The role played by teams will be discussed in early 
lectures.
</p>
<h1>Examinations and Grades</h1>
<p>Your grade for this course will be based upon your accumulated scores from two online quizzes, a
midterm exam (either both online and essay or online only), a final in-class exam, and a final online exam, plus a small team score based upon class
projects. Also, as stated above, your score can be adjusted down due to lack of attendance.
</p>
<p>The online quizzes will be taken in the last 20 minutes of class time on the dates scheduled in 
the <a href="e136cc.htm">Course Calendar</a>. 
</p> 
<h2>Grade weighting: </h2>
<div id="bpoints">
	<ul>
		<li>Twenty-minute online quizzes: <b>15% each</b></li>
		<li>Mid-term exam (including online portion): <b>30%</b></li>
		<li>Final exam (including online portion): <b>30%</b></li>
		<li>Team participation and class attendance: <b>10%</b></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>The final
10% of your grade will be determined by your contribution to class and team projects, including class
attendance. With reasonable good-faith effort, you should be able to get full credit for this 10% of
your grade.
</p>
<p>
Your final grade will be based upon a final distribution for the class after the scores above have been posted. 
The cutoff points for different letter grades are not determined until I have evaluated that final 
distribution. If you are concerned about your grade prior to the final, do not ask me what score 
you will have to earn to meet your grade target. I will not know because I will not have seen the 
final distribution. I don’t (really can’t) give extra credit assignments to compensate for low exam 
scores. There is no extra credit and there are no makeups.
</p>
<p>
You have the right to appeal a grade on an exam so long as the following procedure is used: 
</p>
<p>To appeal a grade on an essay exam question, you must submit to me the basis of your complaint (explaining 
why you should have been given a higher score) in writing on an 8 1/2" by 11" sheet of paper 
within a week of receiving back your graded exam. I will be willing to talk to you at length about 
your exam, but not about changing the score on your exam, unless you have first followed the procedure 
above.  To this rule I make one exception: if I have improperly posted your grade because 
I made a mistake adding the score, you need only tell me.
</p>
<p>
<b>Policy on Pass/No Pass: I automatically allow any student who wishes to take the course on a 
P/NP basis to do so if the student is eligible. HOWEVER, to receive a passing grade the student 
must have accumulated enough points to receive the equivalent  C- or better! Prior to the final, 
do not ask me how many points you must earn on the final to pass. I will not tell you because I 
will not know. Your final grade will depend upon the final distribution after the final has been 
taken. Also, if you are P/NP status, to earn a passing grade for this class, regardless of your 
prior scores, <font color="red"> you must pass the final exam in-class exam and the final take-home 
exam </font> if one is assigned. If you 
receive a score on the final exam alone that I deem to be a failing grade, and you are registered 
as a P/NP student, I will assign an NP for the course.</b> This policy does not necessarily apply to 
students taking the course for a grade (because you are merely going to get a very low grade, 
possibly an F).
</p>
<h1>About the somewhat unstructured nature of this course</h1>
<p>This course covers some very complex material at a very advanced level. This course is taught 
at a level used in the second year of a Ph.D. program in finance (based upon the book used in 
this course). This material can be very challenging for both the student and the teacher. This 
stuff is difficult to teach. Also this course is extremely lecture-dependent. The reference 
reading material is difficult to understand without explanation. Further, although the scheduling 
of material in this course appears to be linear - we actually work simultaneously on different tasks, 
as is explained in the <a href="e136cc.htm">Course Calendar</a>.
Also, the pace of progress varies because I will not move on from one topic to the next until I am 
sure the class understands it (it builds in the major sections - if you don't understand step 1 
you won't understand step 2). I experiment with how I teach these topics. I constantly discard or change 
lectures. Some thrusts fail. In some areas we have to backtrack.
</p>
<h1>Video and Audio</h1>
<p>
You are not allowed to use video or audio recording equipment in my classroom without my express 
<i><b>written</i></b> permission (permission by email constitutes written permission). If you have some reason 
to do it, you might ask and I might allow it. There are two reasons for this: (1) all of my material 
including oral presentations is my copyrighted material and I have the right to control it, and more 
important, (2) unauthorized recordings can have a stifling affect upon free and open speech. What goes 
on in the classroom is between you and me, not you and me and everyone who watches YouTube.
</p>
<p>The <i><b>YouTube</b></i> live recordings that I use in some other courses 
are not used in this course. On the other hand, a lot of the lecture material is presented as video. You 
are as responsible for video content as you are in-class lectures.
</p>
<h1>How to Contact Me</h1>
<p>
Although I am often in my office, Parsons 1261, the best way to reach me is by appointment via email at 
evans at g dot hmc dot edu. My formal office hours this semester are 
after this class, from 9:30 until 10:30 on Tuesday and from 1:30 until 2:30 on Tuesday and Thursday 
(but check by email).
</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you in this class. </p>
