<h1>Course Lecture Page</h1>
<p><b><font color= "red">Note! Change to course calendar for last half of class.</b></font> Because campus instruction was
shifted to remote learning for the second half of the semester, the Course Calendar was modified for this course, including
the exam schedule. You can use the link above to go the the new Course Calendar to see the changes and new deadlines.
</p>
<p>All remaining lectures for the semester will be video lectures, linked as before in the <b>YouTube video recordings</b>
section of this page. For each
subject the videos will be shorter and there will be more of them (typically three or four).
</p>
<hr>
<p>Written material used in this class, mostly a series of essays,
some of them written like book chapters, are made available on the 
<a href="../books/macro/macrotext.htm">Econ 53 Texts</a> 
page. Reading assignments are made in the 
<a href="e53cc.htm">Course Calendar</a>. 
Because the essays are frequently updated, you are advised to not read
the material until it has been formally assigned.</p>
<p>
This page is dedicated to the course lectures. Copies of the lecture slides are posted at the top of this page
before each lecture so that students can follow the lecture in class. Video (<b><i>Youtube</i></b>) recordings of the lectures, 
linked from the middle of the page, are posted typically the day after the lecture is given. Finally, archival
copies of the lecture slides from the last time the course was taught are posted at the bottom of the page so that
visitors to this site always have access to a full set of lectures. As each new lecture is given, the archival lecture
is replaced with a new lecture.
