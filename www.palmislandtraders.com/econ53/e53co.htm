<h1>Course Outline for Spring 2020</h1>
<p><font color="red"><b>Note! </b></font>The grading policy for this class has been changed. See
the information, effective April 6, 2020, below in the <b>Revised Grade Policy</b>.
</P
<p>
Welcome to Economics 53, Introduction to Macroeconomics. This course is beginning at a 
time when economic growth is steady, trade skirmishes with international trading partners, 
especially China, continue to threaten growth but are stabilizing, and our nation's central 
banking authority, the Federal Reserve System, is still searching for an optimal policy while a
major election looms on the horizon.

Meanwhile the stock market had an explosive 12 months while Bitcoin and
the crypto-currencies try to rebound from a weak year. From an economics perspective, this is going
to be an interesting year.
</p>
<p>
So what lies ahead?
</p>
<p>
This course is inherently topical. We will read talk about these subjects and many 
others that are related. We will study the economic topics that you often read about 
in the newspaper: inflation, deflation, interest rate behavior, employment and unemployment, 
international trade, exchange rates, the financial markets, business cycles, national production, 
taxes, the federal budget, budget deficits, Social Security, and so forth. In a few words, we 
will investigate the American economy at an introductory level. 
</p>
<p>
You are not required to purchase a textbook for this course.  This course uses online 
reading material, audio podcasts, and videos only.  We will use five chapters from an 
internet-based macroeconomics modeling book written by me. These chapters are placed 
on the web site for this class in <i>PDF</i> format. This will enable you to display 
and print them as you need them. Many of the reading assignments for this course are 
drawn from U.S. government and other web sites.  The reading assignments and the 
sources are found on the <a href="e53cc.htm">
Course Calendar</a> page and an organized copy of the sources are also found on the
<a href="../books/macro/macrotext.htm">E53 Texts</a> page. 
</p>
<p>
PowerPoint versions of all lectures in this class are provided in advance (typically on 
the day or the day before they are given) on the 
<a href="e53ls.htm"> Lecture Slides</a> and Course Content page. 
Other support material (not much) and archival lectures from last year, along with 
video recordings of current lectures posted after they are given, are also posted on 
this site.
</p>
If you get lost you can always consult the master web site for all of my classes, which 
is found at:
</p>
<p>
<a href="../index.html">
https://www.palmislandtraders.com</a>
</p>
<p>
Some homework information and important reminders are sent out to the class master list 
by email. Therefore, please make sure that you are on the mailing list!
</p>
<h1>Course Objectives</h1>
<p>
In this class I offer a general overview of the U.S. economy in the hope that you will
retain some of it after the course has ended.  We explore such topics as 
economic growth, business cycles, the structure of the economy, employment and 
unemployment, inflation, and government monetary and fiscal policy.  To some extent I 
hope to show you how economists identify and think about economic problems.  There is 
some exposure to theory and modeling in this class so you can see how we organize general 
economic concepts into analytic models.  
</p>
<h1>Reading Strategy</h1>
<p>
It really helps if you read the assigned material (or listen to it or watch it) before 
lectures on the subject (it helps me, actually). The reading sets the stage and in some 
cases eliminates my need to talk about certain things. Instead of a single expensive textbook, 
we are drawing our reading material from a variety of sources, all of which are free.  
You must try to discipline yourself to check the 
<a href="e53cc.htm">Course Calendar</a>
for the weekly or sectional reading assignments, to find them on the internet, 
to print them and/or to read them. 
</p>
<h1>Lecture Slides and other support material</h1>
<p>
All of my lectures are posted prior to the actual lecture. Some are posted just before the 
lecture (because I work on them sometimes right up until the lecture) but always will be 
posted. I used to send the class an email when that material became available but decided to
cut back on email messages in recent years. These lecture notes are yours 
to use as you please. In recent years students using tablets taking notes on these slides 
seem to benefit from this arrangement. These slides are found on the 
<a href="e53ls.htm">Lecture Slides and Course
Content </a> page.
</p>
<p>As I have done for the last couple of years in this class and Economics 104, I will stream 
each lecture live on the <b>ProfGREvans <i>YouTube</i></b> channel, then each lecture will 
remain in the archive under the <b>Econ 53</b> playlist. Therefore, 
effectively, the entire class has a complete digital record accessible from the Course Content page.
It is perfectly acceptable to me if you rely upon the <b>ProfGREvans </b>
videos for the lectures. This practice, however, imposes a burden upon you to meet your 
responsibilities to yourself, to me, and to the class. Not all students have been successful
at doing that, so I will say considerably more about that in the opening lecture. 
</p>
<h1><font color="red">Revised Grade Policy</font></h1>
<p>
Your grade will be based upon scores from the first traditional exam and four online quizzes that are
given after April 6th.</p>
<p>
The results of the first exam will be reduced from 200 possible points to 50 possible points to give
it the same weight as the other exams. (Example: if you had a score of 176 on the first exam, that will
be reduced to a 44 of 50).
</p>
<p>The quizzes will not have equal weight (although they will be close in weight).
</p>
<p>
Prof Evans will retain your four best scores from the five exams and base your grade upon a percentage
distribution of that. As promised elsewhere, grading will be generous compared to normal semesters.
<p>
Policy on Pass/No Pass: You are allowed to take this course P/NC by merely asking. There are no restrictions.
</p>
<h1>Class Attendance and Email Notifications</h1>
<p>
I don't require students to attend my lectures. However, please understand that this is a 
<i><b>lecture-based course</i></b>.  I pull a lot of material together in the lectures.  From years past 
I have noticed that there is some correlation between class attendance and grades. </p>
<p>Having access to the lectures on <i><b>YouTube </b></i>makes it easier to 
miss live lectures and
many students in the past have stated that they appreciate the freedom provided by this option. 
<b><i>Beware</i></b>, however, that in past semesters some students have abused this privilege and have seen
their grades consequently suffer. The failure rate for both Economics 53 and Economics 104, where I
also allow this privilege, has risen in recent years because students who fall behind in the lectures
and plan to catch up never get around to it.</p>
<p>Also please understand that I ask some questions on exams about material that is covered <i>only</i>
in the lecture and not in the written material nor in the slides (which are general summary documents
anyway). </p>
<p>
Because many students do miss class, I now impose certain rules. First, if you are absent for any 
reason it is your responsibility to obtain the class material that you missed, but given that all 
of it is online, including lecture slides, that shouldn't be a problem. Finally, although I sometimes 
allow students to reschedule exams for legitimate reasons (typically job interviews, clinic excursions, 
or illness), <i><b>I cannot reschedule exams for students who are overloaded with work</i></b>. Please 
realize that if you anticipate a heavy schedule around exam time, try to schedule your work so that 
there is less of a crush.
</p>
<p>Because class attendance is optional I do require students to check all email that is sent by me
regarding this class. Email messages are now considered part of class content and as a student in this
class <i><b>you are required to read your email </b></i> within a reasonable period of time.
Those emails often include notifications and reminders of due dates or material that might be on an
exam and you are accountable for that material.
</p>
<h1>Course Conflicts Between This Course and Another Course</h1>
<p>Because this course offers all lectures online, students sometimes ask me if I allow course conflicts
with other courses scheduled at the same time, as I do in Economics 104. Alas, in this class course 
conflicts are not allowed. 
Conflicts are allowed in Economics 104 because there is no replacement course for Economics 104. But
there are many Macroeconomics courses offered at the 5Cs. Course conflicts involve a lot of extra work
for me at exam time, so for the time-being I follow a no-conflict policy,
</p>
<h1>Video and Audio</h1>
<p>
You are not allowed to use video or audio recording equipment in my classroom without my express 
<i><b>written</i></b> permission (permission by email constitutes written permission). If you have some reason 
to do it, you might ask and I might allow it. There are two reasons for this prohibition: (1) all of my material 
including oral presentations is copyrighted material that belongs to me and I have the right to control it, 
and more important, (2) unauthorized recordings can have a stifling affect upon free and open speech. What goes 
on in the classroom is between you and me, not you and me and everyone who watches <i>YouTube</i>.
</p>
<h1>How to Contact Me</h1>
<p>
Although I am often in my office, Parsons 1261, the best way to reach me is by appointment via email at 
garyrevans at gmail dot com or at evans at g dot hmc dot edu. My formal office hours this semester are 
from 10:00 until 11:00 on Tuesday and from 1:30 until 2:30 on Tuesday and Thursday (but check by email).
</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you in this class. </p>
