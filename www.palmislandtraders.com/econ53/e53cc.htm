<h1>Course Calendar for Spring 2020</h1>
<p>
This class is arranged in sections by dates. This calendar was revised substantially as the pandemic interferred with the semester, 
<b>exam dates are subject to change with adequate warning.</b>
</p>
<p>
You should try to read the assigned material before the lecture is given. Because some of this material is added or altered
as the course proceeds, if a link is inactive that means that the material has not yet been updated (this will be explained
more in the first lecture).
</p>
<p><b><font color="red">Note! Altered schedule and new policy about exams: </font></b>Because of the suspension of classes at Harvey 
Mudd, the calendar below will be modified to reflect this new reality. Additional exams will still be given. See the 
revised (twice) calendar below.
</p>
<p>The exams will be take-home online quizzes that you can take from anywhere with an internet connection. You will also be allowed 
to take the exam over a 24 hour period which limited choice of days. Other accomodations might be possible if requested.
</p>
<p>The exams will be easier than the originals would have been and I will adjust grades up substantially to compensate of the
stress we all feel. But please remember that you are expected to engage this class at least as a minimal level. After all, it is
rather topical.
