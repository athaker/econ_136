<h1>Economics 136 - Advanced Financial Markets and Modeling</h1>
<p><b><font color="red"> Note: </font></b>This was an advanced course that requires advanced math skills and
the ability to program in Python. This course also had a prerequisite of Economics 104 or an equivalent course. 
</p>
<p>
This advanced course introduces students to the world of derivatives and financial modelling.  We explore 
the different classes of derivatives like put and call options and futures contracts, and their designs 
and applications.  We will discover how the use of certain derivatives can mitigate or 
even eliminate certain types of business risk. We will discuss and develop algorithmic trading strategies. 
Topics to be covered include a review of measures of risk and volatility and the statistical 
means to make estimates of those measures, including the use of Fourier Transforms. Throughout the course 
we explore a series of value and pricing models, such as the classical Black-Scholes-Merton model but also 
more modern and experimental models. Students are introduced to numerous realistic problems and case studies.

<h1>Social Sciences 147 - Enterprise and the Entrepreneur</h1>
<p>
Do you believe in a Koz that you want to promote? Do you have what it takes to run your own business? 
What role is played by the entrepreneur in our market economy? We discuss all of this and more. 
This was a course where the student played a very active role, including getting up on your feet 
to promote your causes and pitch your ideas. In the second half of the course you had to work 
as part of a team, building and promoting your own organization.
