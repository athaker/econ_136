<p>These
are the links to the individual chapters of the free online book <b style="">Introduction to Financial Markets and
Instruments</b>, which is used in the <b style="">Economics
104 - Financial Economics </b>course taught at Harvey Mudd
College by Professor
Gary Evans.
</p>
<p>This book is offered in only this
format (chapter by
chapter). This book is constantly being revised and updated, chapter by
chapter, throughout the year, typically one chapter at a time. There is
seldom any
chapter in this book that is more than one year old. As can be seen
below, the
date of the version of each chapter is listed and no two chapters have
the same
date.</p>
<p>In
a field like finance, markets and instruments change so rapidly that
any text that attempts to explain how these markets work must be
frequently
updated. This is best done by a <b style=""><i style="">dynamic
</i></b>online textbook - one that is going
through a constant revision at all times.</p>
<p>The reader will note that the
numerous examples in the
chapters are very current. They may be drawing upon incidents that are
only a
few weeks old. Likewise the graphs and data are very current.</p>
<p>The chapters are printed in pdf
format, which are easy
to download and print, or simply read through a viewer or computer
screen. Click on the title.</p>

	mutual funds, but overcoming many of the disadvantages of mutual funds,
	ETPs are now required knowledge for even the most basic retail
	investment account. But in addition to the advantages over mutual
	funds, many ETPs are for more risky than mutual funds and some should
	be avoided altogether by the retail investor. This chapter explains the

	tips about finding and buying a home. The chapter has a lengthy

	This is	a short and cryptic chapter about
	different kinds of formal retirement accounts like 401-K, Roth IRA and
	other IRA accounts, and describes their features including tax
	advantages and disadvantages, contribution limits and how they are
	used. This material is kept current for the present tax year (although
	it is not normally updated until after April 15 of any tax year). It is
	treated here as an appendix rather than a full chapter because it is
	linked to a lecture video that should be viewed any time this material
	is read. In Economics 104, the video is used instead of a classroom
	lecture.
